# Fixed Version of Local Chat App with SQLite Vector Search

This document provides instructions for using the fixed version of the chat app, which resolves JSON parsing issues when communicating with Ollama.

## What's Been Fixed

The original application encountered JSON parsing errors when communicating with the Ollama API. These errors typically appeared as:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 122 (line 2 column 1)
```

The fix addresses this issue by:

1. Creating a more robust Ollama client with better error handling
2. Improving the response parsing mechanism to handle malformed JSON responses
3. Adding fallback mechanisms to ensure the chat always returns a meaningful response

## How to Use the Fixed Version

The fixes have been implemented in two new files:

- `backend/ollama-client-fixed.js` - A more robust Ollama client
- `backend/server-fixed-v2.js` - An updated server that uses the fixed client

The `package.json` file has been updated to use the fixed server by default.

### Running the Fixed Version

Simply start the application as usual:

```bash
npm start
```

This will use the fixed server version automatically. If you want to use the original version for any reason, you can run:

```bash
npm run start:legacy
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust JSON Parsing**: The fixed Ollama client now handles malformed JSON responses gracefully by attempting multiple parsing strategies.

2. **Better Error Handling**: Error messages are now properly formatted and returned to the user interface instead of causing the application to crash.

3. **Response Format Detection**: The client now adapts to different response formats that Ollama might return, ensuring compatibility with different Ollama versions.

4. **Debugging Endpoint**: A new `/api/test-ollama` endpoint has been added for directly testing the Ollama connection.

## Testing the Fix

To verify that the fix works:

1. Start the application with `npm start`
2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port)
3. Try asking a question in the chat interface

You should now receive proper responses from the model without the JSON parsing errors.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Make sure Ollama is running properly with `ollama list` in your terminal
2. Check that the Mistral model is properly installed with `ollama pull mistral`
3. Try the test endpoint with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-ollama -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt":"Hello, world!"}'
   ```
4. Check your server logs for any detailed error messages

## Technical Details of the Fix

The primary issue was that Ollama's response format was sometimes inconsistent or contained unexpected characters that broke JSON parsing. The fixed client now:

1. First captures the raw text response before attempting to parse it
2. Attempts standard JSON parsing first
3. If that fails, tries to extract valid JSON objects from the response
4. Falls back to using the raw text as the response content if all parsing attempts fail
5. Always returns a properly structured response object with meaningful error messages

This ensures that even if there are issues with the Ollama API response, the application will continue to function and provide feedback to the user rather than crashing.
